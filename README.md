### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser to run the RGB Color Generator. This tool works best on:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox

- Microsoft Edge

## Usage

1. Open the RGB Color Generator in your web browser.

3. The tool will display a random RGB color.
4. Click the "Copy" button to copy the color to your clipboard.
5. Use the copied color in your design or development project.

## How It Works

The RGB Color Generator uses JavaScript to create random RGB values. Each time you click the "Generate Color" button, the application generates three random numbers between 0 and 255. These numbers represent the red, green, and blue components of the color.

Here's a brief overview of the color generation process:

1. **Random Number Generation**: The application uses the `Math.random()` function to generate random numbers.
2. **RGB Color Creation**: Each number corresponds to a color component (red, green, blue). The combination of these components forms a unique color.
3. **Display and Copy Functionality**: The generated color is displayed on the screen, and users can easily copy it to their clipboard.
